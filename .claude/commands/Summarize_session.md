2. Note any problems solved and solutions implemented  
3. Record any new issues discovered or blockers encountered
4. Update progress status for ongoing features
5. Add this summary to the appropriate documentation files:
   - .claude/CLAUDE.md - for technical changes and setup updates
   - .claude/PRD.md - for product requirement updates and feature status
   - .claude/ROADMAP_MASTER_V3.md - for roadmap progress and task completion tracking
   - .claude/README.md - for all new informations that enhance the product

IMPORTANT! Don't use any other document or create new markdown exept the validation of the user. Summarize in the dedicated documents which are .claude/CLAUDE.md, .claude/PRD.md .claude/ROADMAP_MASTER_V3.md and .claude/README.md
This ensures continuity between sessions and maintains accurate project documentation.
