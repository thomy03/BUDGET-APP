# Run Multi-Agents

Execute multiple specialized agents in parallel for efficient task completion.

## Instructions

When handling complex tasks that can benefit from parallel processing:
1. Identify the available agents in .claude/agents directory
2. Analyze which agents are best suited for different aspects of the task
3. Launch multiple specialized agents in parallel when appropriate:
   - Use Task tool to spawn agents concurrently 
   - Coordinate agents for different parts of the same task
   - Leverage agent specializations (frontend, backend, testing, etc.)
4. Ensure agents work efficiently together without conflicts
5. Synthesize results from multiple agents into a cohesive solution

This approach maximizes performance and leverages specialized agent capabilities.
